# Plagiarism_Detection

**A tool to detect textual plagiarism or similarity between documents.**

## 🚀 Project Overview  
**What is this:** This project provides a way for users to submit text or documents and analyze whether there is plagiarism or high similarity between them.  
**Why this exists:** To help students / researchers / content creators check for duplicate or overlapping content easily, using an automated back-end and a user-friendly front-end.  
**How it works (high level):**  
- The back-end (Python) processes the submitted documents / text inputs and computes similarity / plagiarism using defined algorithms.  
- The front-end (web) allows users to upload or paste documents, submit for checking, and view results (e.g. similarity score, overlapping segments).  

## 📦 Tech Stack  
- **Back-end:** Python (see `requirements.txt` for dependencies)  
- **Front-end:** JavaScript / HTML / CSS (npm-managed, see `package.json`)  
- **Libraries / frameworks:** *(fill this in — e.g. Flask, FastAPI, React, Express, etc.)*  
- **Other tools:** Virtual environment for Python, npm for front-end dependencies
